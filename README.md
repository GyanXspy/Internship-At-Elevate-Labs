# Internship-At-Elevate-Labs

# Day1
What I Did
Developed a Java-based console calculator for basic arithmetic operations.

Implemented:

    Addition

    Subtraction

    Multiplication

    Division (with zero-division check)

Used methods for each operation to promote clean code and reusability.

Created a menu-driven interface using Scanner for user input.

Ensured error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero).

# Day2
What I Did
    Created a Student Management System in Java using a menu-driven console application.

    Used OOP concepts: encapsulation, constructors, getters/setters, and toString().

    Implemented CRUD operations:

        Add: Input student details and add to ArrayList.

        Display: Show all student records.

        Remove: Delete student by ID.

        Update: Modify name and marks by ID.

    Used Java Scanner for user input and ArrayList for data storage (in-memory).

# Day3
What I Did
    Created a Library Management System in Java using a menu-driven console-style structure.
    Applied OOP concepts: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, constructors, and method overriding.
    Implemented core features:

        Add: Add new books to the library.

        Issue: Issue a book to a user by ISBN.

        Return: Return a previously issued book.

        Display: Show all book details (title, author, ISBN, issued status).

    Used Java ArrayList to store books.
